## Game
Beyblade is a competitive game where players battle using customizable tops in an arena called a Beystadium. Each Beyblade has three parts: the Energy Layer (attack style), Forge Disc (weight and balance), and Performance Tip (movement and stamina). Players strategically assemble their Beyblades to outlast or knock out opponents, earning points by bursting tops, knocking them out, or spinning the longest. The game combines strategy, physics, and creativity.
